# Renewable energy data analysis
The purpose of this project was to do an exploratory data analysis on a data set from, https://data.openup.org.za/.

The data set selected is the Renewable_energy file, [Renewable_energy.csv](https://github.com/DVan-de-yar/git/files/7490436/Renewable_energy.csv).
Which contains information about the location of different renewable energy systems in the 9 South African provinces and their capacity values amongst other information.

The data set was edited and cleaned in various ways that can be seen in the Renewable_energy.ipynb file.

##### You will need to:
* Download and install anaconda with its built-in jupyter notebook to read this file.
* Modules such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn will have to installed in either the anaconda prompt or the command line ,both can be found using the search icon.

All the findings that were made based on the analysis of this data set can be found in this EDA document,[Renewable_energy_EDA.docx](https://github.com/DVan-de-yar/git/files/7490449/Renewable_energy_EDA.docx).
